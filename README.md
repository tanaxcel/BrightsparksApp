<h1>Brightsparks Android App</h>
<p>An unofficial Brightsparks application that allows users to access the Brightsparks portal with just a click of a button. It does away with having to constantly use our web browsers to search for the website. It gives users the full experience of the Brightsparks portal, allowing them to apply for scholarships, check the scholarship applications and pursue higher education, all in one app.</p>
<p>Technical details: This application was made possible using Android Studio, where I coded the app in both Java and XML languages. It employs 4 building blocks: 1. Imageview: Display an image of Brightsparks logo 2. Button: An "Enter" button which allows the user to jump to another activity which is to view the webpage 3. Textview: A text showing that I created the app. 4. Webview: Displays webpage: Main webpage is https://brightsparks.com.sg/login.php</p>
